This keyboard layout has been built as an extension of the current macOS "Inuktitut â€“ Nunavut" keyboard layout that users are already familiar with. All syllabics keys are consistent with the Inuktitut â€“Â Nunavut keyboard positions with the following exceptions to incorporate the required Nattilik characters:

1. The Nattilik syllabic characters `ð‘ª° ð‘ª² ð‘ª´ ð‘ª¶ ð‘ª¸ ð‘ªº á•  á•¤ á•¦ á–¨ á–ª á–¬` occupy the numeral keys (1234567890) in the **shift** layer (Caps Lock Off).
2. The Nattilik final naanit `á–®` is accessible in the **option** layer.
3. The Nattilik Roman orthography letters can be accessed in the **Caps Lock On**, **option** and **shift + option** layers.
